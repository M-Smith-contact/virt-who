virt-who is agent for reporting virtual guest IDs to subscription-manager.

It uses libvirt-python to obtain UUIDs of all virtual guests present
in the system (both running and stopped). It then connects to
subscription-manager server (candlepin) and set the list of UUIDs to facts
about host system.


Installation
------------
To just install it use:

# make DESTDIR=/usr install

You can also create rpm package with:

$ make rpm

and then install the package


Configuration
-------------

It uses rhsm configuration (usually in /etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf). The system needs
to be registered in subscription-manager server before running the agent.

Usage
-----

This agent has two modes of running. First [default] is to obtain UUIDs, send
them to the server and exit. Second mode is running in infinite loop and
monitor guests UUIDs changes. When some change happens it will be immediately
send.
